Project started with:
# Vue Enterprise Boilerplate

## Features

- [**Thorough documentation**](#documentation): Written with the same care as Vue's core docs to quickly train new team members and consolidate knowledge.
- [**Guaranteed consistency**](docs/linting.md): Opinionated linting for Vue, JavaScript/JSON, SCSS, and Markdown, integrated into Visual Studio Code and run against staged files on pre-commit.
- [**First-class tests**](docs/tests.md): Practice test-driven development with both unit and end-to-end tests. Unit tests with Jest live as first-class citizens alongside your source files, while Cypress provides reliable end-to-end tests in an intuitive GUI for development.
- [**Speedy development**](docs/development.md): Between [configurable generators](docs/development.md#generators), [handy aliases](docs/development.md#aliases), and [global base components](docs/development.md#base-components), your productivity will skyrocket.
